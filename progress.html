        <h1>Tyler Buoy Project Progress Report</h1>
        <h1>Comparing position to Yds/Drive line and dot plot</h1>
        <p>
            This is my first idea it is to use a line and dot plot to plot the data.</br>
            I will also impliment a hover function over the dots on the graph so that you can see the players name.</br>
            I also plan on taking you idea for the comparison bettwen 2 players using the golf hole I plan on having you select</br>
            the player's that you want to compare by clicking on 2 of the dots and then it will use there data to create the golf comparison.</br>
            For chosing what to compare I will always have the x axis be the players rank and make an html form so that the user can select the stats to compare.</br>
            The purpose of this is to show all of the top 50 players so that the viewer can get a idea for the corelation aswell as to act as a selection for the golf hole part of the visualization</br>
        </p>

    <h1>Comparing position to Yds/Drive dot plot</h1>
    <p>
        This is my second idea it is to use a dot plot for the data.</br>
        I will also impliment a hover function over the dots on the graph so that you can see the players name.</br>
        I also plan on taking you idea for the comparison bettwen 2 players using the golf hole I plan on having you select</br>

    <h1>Comparing position to Yds/Drive dot plot + trend line</h1>
    <p>
        This is my third idea for the main part of the visualization and this is the one that I believe would work the best with this data set</br>
        It will be kinda like the ones from above except it will have a trend line instead of lines connecting it all or a just a dot plot will also have the html form</br>
        This idea will also contain the html form to choose as well as the hover to reveal name and the clicking on the dots to choose the 2 people to compare in the secondary part</br>
